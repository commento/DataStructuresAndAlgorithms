Problem 1 LRU Cache.

Algorithms for get() and set() are both based upon ordered list implementation. The approach for the cache is FIFO.
Cache get() has time complexity O(1). space complexity is O(1).
Cache set() has time complexity O(1). space complexity is O(1).

Tests involves:
- Test1 -> normal scenario
- Test2 -> Empty cache
- Test3 -> overwritten cache (using FIFO)
