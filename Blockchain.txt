Problem 5 Blockchain.

Time complexity of append() is O(n), where n is the number of blocks inside the linked list, time complexity can be reduced to O(1) saving the tail element. Size complexity is linear O(1).
Time complexity of size() is O(n), where n is the number of blocks inside the linked list, time complexity can be reduced to O(1) saving the tail element. Size complexity is linear O(1).

Tests provide verification for append() and size() implementation.
