Problem 2 File Recursion.

Algorithm loops for each element in the path, distinguishes between file and folder and recursively looks for the file suffix inside the folders.
Time complexity is O(n*m) where n number of element in list (list_dir) and m is the depth of the recursion.
Size complexity is O(elems*depth) where elems is the size of the list and depth is the depth of the recursion.

Tests are referrifing to absolute path on my computer. To be updated in order to run them on another machine.
