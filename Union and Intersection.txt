Problem 6 Union and Intersection.

Time complexity of union() is O(n*m + l*m), where n is the number of elements inside the first linked list, l is the number of elements inside the second linked list and m is the number of elements inside the linked list where the result is stored. 
Space complexity is O(1) because two node instances are used to traverse the linked list.
Time complexity of intersection() is O(n*m*l), where n is the number of elements inside the first linked list, l is the number of elements inside the second linked list and m is the number of elements inside the linked list where the result is stored. Space complexity is O(1).
Space complexity is O(1) because two node instances are used to traverse the linked list.

Tests provide verification for union and intersection in three different scenarios.
