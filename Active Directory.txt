Problem 4 Active Directory.

Algorithm is implemented as a for loop that searches recursively in every group present in groups list.
Time complexity is O(n*m), where n is the number of groups in the list and m is the depth of the recursion. This worst case analysis assumes that the number of groups for each recursion is always the same (n).
Space complexity is (elem*depth) , where elem is a Group class instance and depht is the recursion depth.

Test1 -> check user in subchilds
Test2 -> check empty child without any user, expected return False
Test3 -> check user in same level group
